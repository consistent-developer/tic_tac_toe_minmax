    <ul>
      <li>The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.</li>
      <li>You are ""O",the computer in this case is X. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.</li>
      <li>The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.</li>
      <li>When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>To beat the computer (or at least tie), you need to make use of a little bit of strategy. Strategy means figuring out what you need to do to win.</li>
      <li>Part of your strategy is trying to figure out how to get three Os in a row. The other part is trying to figure out how to stop the computer from getting three Xs in a row.</li>
      <li>After you put an "O" in a square, you start looking ahead. Where's the best place for your next "O"? You look at the empty squares and decide which ones are good choicesâ€”which ones might let you make three "O"s in a row.</li>
      <li>You also have to watch where the computer puts its "X". That could change what you do next. If the computer gets two "X"s in a row, you have to put your next "O" in the last empty square in that row, or the computer will win. You are forced to play in a particular square or lose the game.</li>
      <li>If you always pay attention and look ahead, you'll never lose a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. You may not win, but at least you'll tie.</li>
